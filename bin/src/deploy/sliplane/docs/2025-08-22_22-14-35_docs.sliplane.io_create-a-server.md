# Create a Server

Before you can deploy a service with Sliplane, you need to create a server first. Servers are running your services and they are able to host multiple services on them.

Servers are assigned to your currently active team and get billed on the payment method associated with that team.

We do not run our own data centers. Instead, all of our servers are from *Hetzner GmbH*.

To get started, head over to the [servers overview](https://sliplane.io/app/servers) and click ***Create Server*** on the top right of the page. You can get here by clicking on ***Servers*** in the left sidebar.

## Location

[Section titled “Location”](#location)

When creating a server, you can choose from five different locations:

- 🇩🇪 Germany, Nürnberg
- 🇩🇪 Germany, Falkenstein
- 🇫🇮 Finland, Helsinki
- 🇺🇸 US, Ashburn VA
- 🇺🇸 US, Hillsboro, OR
- 🇸🇬 SG, Singapore

## Server Types

[Section titled “Server Types”](#server-types)

Servers differ depending on their CPU, memory and disk size.

Choosing the right server heavily depends on your use case. However, most small applications out there, that do not carry out very resource intensive tasks, will go a long way with the instances that Sliplane provides.

In general we recommend just starting with the smallest instance and having an eye on CPU, disk and memory usage. Sliplane makes it very easy to scale these servers later on and move services across servers as you need to.

You can view all instances that are available on the [pricing section of our homepage](https://sliplane.io/#pricing).

## Additional Info

[Section titled “Additional Info”](#additional-info)

As an additional info, you can choose a name for your server, so that you can easily identify it later on.

## Startup Time

[Section titled “Startup Time”](#startup-time)

If you first create a new server, it will take some time for it to be ready to install everything and start deploying services. This startup time depends on the instance type of your server and can worse case take up to five minutes.

## Cost and Free Trial

[Section titled “Cost and Free Trial”](#cost-and-free-trial)

You will be charged for servers that you create based on the number of minutes that the servers have been running until they are deleted, but you can create a ***demo server*** for free to try out our service, even if there is no payment method in your account. Demo servers are limited in resources and can only be created twice.

If you are ready and want your data to persist, please add a payment method to your team, which will convert the demo server to a paid server. You can find out how in the [Billing](/teams/getting-started) section.
