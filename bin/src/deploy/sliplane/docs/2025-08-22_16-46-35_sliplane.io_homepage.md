It is just sooo great!!

" At first it did not seem to be customizable enough.. but sliplane does everything I need and is so intuitive on the way! When vonnecting my cloudflare domain, it even instantly sent me an email with a necessary (though very tiny) extra configuration on cloudflare! I am so glad I use this service and am very interested in the future of it. "

Docker hosting as it should be

" Sliplane allows to build and host docker containers from Git-repositories with a fixed and affordable pricing. It simply works as expected. Adding persistent volumes to a container is a breeze, so hosting of stateful services (as databases) is straightforward. With a few clicks you can setup an orchestrated application without any knowledge about Kubernetes. "

Very welcomed alternative for simple cloud hosting in Europe!

" I ' m delighted to have discovered Sliplane after exploring several European alternatives to Heroku in my quest to transition away from US-based services like Render.com, Fly.io, and Heroku. Sliplane stands out not only for its cost-effectiveness in running services with exceptional flexibility but also for its highly responsive and competent support team. Having previously used build pack-based PaaS providers, I found the shift to Docker-based deployments with Sliplane to be seamless and straightforward. I wholeheartedly recommend Sliplane. It is significantly more affordable than Scalingo and offers a more comprehensive feature set compared to Bunny.net when evaluating European alternatives. "

Very easy to use and fantastic customer service

" I am very happy with Sliplane ' s offerings. The setup of my application with nginx, php, and mariadb container services was easy to get deployed. I hooked up my GitHub repo, created multiple services, got to pick the Dockerfile in my repo per service and Sliplane ' s deploy process took care of building and deploying the containers. This part of the process was really integral to making the deploys easy. Their support was fantastic and helped me to set up my server and containers. They answered my questions about their services and product offerings in a very clear and helpful way. Highly recommend! -Matt "

Love the ease with which I was able to deploy my service with minimal setup

" My vps went down and i was desperately looking for a server to deploy my customer services, it took me less than an hr to get back up, loved that I didnt had to setup an ssl cert and more. It was very easy to point my dns to the api i created and it was prod ready and my startup lived for a day more. "
