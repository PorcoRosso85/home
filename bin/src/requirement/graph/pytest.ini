# マーカー定義
markers =
    # Test speed hierarchy (like log levels)
    instant: Tests that run in < 0.1 seconds (pure functions, unit tests)
    fast: Tests that run in < 1 second (lightweight integration tests)
    normal: Tests that run in < 5 seconds (standard integration tests)
    slow: Tests that run in < 30 seconds (heavy integration tests, E2E)
    very_slow: Tests that run in >= 30 seconds (very heavy E2E tests)
    
    # Additional dynamic marks from mark_test decorator
    # (These are generated programmatically but need to be registered)
    
    # Test types
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: Integration tests requiring database
    e2e: End-to-end tests that use subprocess (deselect with '-m "not e2e"')
    
    # Dependencies
    vss_required: Tests that require VSS service initialization
    db_required: Tests that require database access
    network_required: Tests that require network connectivity
    filesystem_required: Tests that require filesystem operations
    
    # Reliability
    stable: Stable tests that should always pass
    flaky: Tests that may fail intermittently due to timing or external factors
    experimental: Experimental tests that may be unstable
    
    # Performance
    performance: Performance-sensitive tests with specific thresholds
    
    # Custom tags
    smoke: Smoke tests for quick validation
    nightly: Tests for nightly builds
    ci_only: Tests that should only run in CI
    local_only: Tests that should only run locally
    append_only: Custom tag for append-only related tests
    history: Custom tag for history-related tests
