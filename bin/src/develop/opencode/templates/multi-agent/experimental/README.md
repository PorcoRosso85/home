# Experimental Multi-Agent Components

This directory contains advanced multi-agent system components that were moved here to maintain focus on the minimal multi-agent template goal. These components provide additional functionality that may be reintroduced in future iterations.

## Components

### system-health-check.sh
Advanced system health monitoring and diagnostics for multi-agent deployments. Includes comprehensive resource monitoring, performance metrics, and health reporting.

### opencode-multi-agent.sh
Extended multi-agent orchestration system with advanced features beyond the minimal requirements. Provides complex agent coordination and management capabilities.

### opencode-multi-client.sh
Enhanced client implementation with additional features beyond basic HTTP/2 communication. Includes advanced connection management and protocol handling.

### multi-agent-workflow.sh
Sophisticated workflow management system for complex multi-agent task coordination. Provides advanced scheduling and dependency management.

### template-validator.sh
Comprehensive template validation system for ensuring multi-agent system compliance. Includes schema validation and configuration verification.

### doc-generator.sh
Automated documentation generation system for multi-agent components. Creates comprehensive API documentation and system diagrams.

### performance-tester.sh
Advanced performance testing and benchmarking suite for multi-agent systems. Provides load testing, latency measurement, and throughput analysis.

## Purpose

These components were moved to experimental/ to maintain alignment with the minimal multi-agent system goal:
- Pre-auth system
- HTTP/2 communication
- Two servers (orchestrator + session manager)
- Minimal client
- Light orchestration

## Future Reintroduction

These experimental features may be selectively reintroduced based on:
- User requirements and feedback
- System maturity and stability
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration complexity assessment

## Usage

These components are preserved for reference and potential future integration. They are not part of the core minimal multi-agent template but demonstrate advanced capabilities that can be built upon the minimal foundation.
