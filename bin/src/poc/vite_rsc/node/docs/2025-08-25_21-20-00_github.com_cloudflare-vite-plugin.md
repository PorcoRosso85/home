# `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`

The Cloudflare Vite plugin enables a full-featured integration between [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and the [Workers runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/).
Your Worker code runs inside [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), matching the production behavior as closely as possible and providing confidence as you develop and deploy your applications.

```ts
// vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [cloudflare()],
});
```

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/).

## Features

- Uses the Vite [Environment API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) to integrate Vite with the Workers runtime
- Provides direct access to [Workers runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/) and [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)
- Builds your front-end assets for deployment to Cloudflare, enabling you to build static sites, SPAs, and full-stack applications
- Official support for [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) with server-side rendering
- Leverages Vite's hot module replacement for consistently fast updates
- Supports `vite preview` for previewing your build output in the Workers runtime prior to deployment

## Use cases

- React Router v7 (support for more full-stack frameworks is coming soon)
- Static sites, such as single-page applications, with or without an integrated backend API
- Standalone Workers
- Multi-Worker applications

## Key Integration with Vite Environment API

The plugin uses Vite's Environment API to:
1. **Runtime Integration**: Integrates Vite development server with the Workers runtime (workerd)
2. **Environment Separation**: Manages client and worker environments separately
3. **Runtime APIs**: Provides direct access to Workers runtime APIs during development
4. **HMR Support**: Enables hot module replacement across both environments

## Runtime-agnostic の意味

"Runtime-agnostic" means that `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` is:
1. **Not tied to Node.js**: Can work with other JavaScript runtimes
2. **Compatible with Edge Runtimes**: Works with Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, etc.
3. **Environment API Based**: Uses Vite's environment abstraction layer
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Can deploy to various platforms without modification

This enables React Server Components to run on:
- Node.js servers
- Cloudflare Workers (via @cloudflare/vite-plugin)
- Edge functions
- Other V8-based runtimes
