# @cloudflare/vite-plugin

The Cloudflare Vite plugin enables a full-featured integration between [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and the [Workers runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/).
Your Worker code runs inside [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), matching the production behavior as closely as possible and providing confidence as you develop and deploy your applications.

## Key Purpose

This plugin solves the **Node.js constraints problem** by:
1. Running code directly in `workerd` (Cloudflare's runtime) instead of Node.js
2. Using Vite's Environment API to transform Node.js code to Workers-compatible code
3. Providing direct access to Workers runtime APIs and bindings

## Features

- Uses the Vite **Environment API** to integrate Vite with the Workers runtime
- Provides direct access to Workers runtime APIs and bindings
- Builds your front-end assets for deployment to Cloudflare
- Official support for React Router v7 with server-side rendering
- Leverages Vite's hot module replacement
- Supports `vite preview` for previewing your build output in the Workers runtime

## How It Works

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [cloudflare()],
});
```

## Compatibility with @vitejs/plugin-rsc

The plugin is **Runtime-agnostic** compatible, meaning:
- **@vitejs/plugin-rsc** defines the RSC environments (rsc, ssr, client)
- **@cloudflare/vite-plugin** transforms those environments to run on Workers
- They work together via Vite's Environment API

## What This Means for Our Project

**YES, this can solve Node.js constraints:**
1. Replaces Node.js runtime with Workers runtime during development
2. Automatically transforms Node.js APIs to Workers-compatible APIs
3. Handles the edge transformation we've been missing

Instead of:
```
Vite RSC → Node.js build → manual worker-entry.js adapter
```

With this plugin:
```
Vite RSC + @cloudflare/vite-plugin → Workers-ready build
```
