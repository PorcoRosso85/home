You can use adapters to configure your app for different deployment environments. This is a list of available adapters and how to configure them.

- `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel` for Vercel deployment

- `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-netlify` for Netlify deployment
- `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-cloudflare-pages` for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-cloudflare-workers` for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-sst` for Serverless Stack deployment

Add `adapter` entry to your `react-server.config.mjs` file. You can specify the name of the adapter as a string. The adapter package will be resolved from your project ' s dependencies.

```mjs
export default {
  adapter: '@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel',
};
``` You can also specify custom options for all adapters. Configuration options are different for each adapter. Check the page of the adapter for details.

```mjs
export default {
  adapter: [
    '@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel',
    {
      // Custom options
    },
  ],
};
``` You can also import an adapter from a package or file.

```mjs
import adapter from '@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel';

export default {
  adapter: adapter({
    // Custom options
  }),
};
