# Migrate your database

You can migrate databases between different versions of Kuzu without manually writing DDL and COPY statements.
To perform a migration, you would first export the database from an existing Kuzu version using the command `EXPORT DATABASE`.
Then, you would import this database into another Kuzu version using `IMPORT DATABASE`.

## Export database

The `EXPORT DATABASE` command exports all the contents of a Kuzu database to the specified directory.
The command generates the following files under the `/path/to/export` directory, which
are needed to be able to import this database to a new Kuzu version:

- `schema.cypher`: Contains the definitions of all node and edge tables.
- `macro.cypher`: Includes the definitions of all macro functions.
- `copy.cypher`: Contains `COPY FROM` statements for reimporting data.
- `Data files`: These files contain the actual database data (in CSV or Parquet format).

The parameters for `EXPORT DATABASE` are the same as those used
when running [`COPY TO`](https://docs.kuzudb.com/export/) statements. The example below shows how to export a database using default configurations.

```
EXPORT DATABASE '/path/to/export'
```

The default behaviour is to export the data tables to Parquet format. This is done to reduce scope of formatting errors and to improve performance. You can use the `format` parameter to output to other formats, for e.g. CSV.
The `format` parameter can either be `csv` or `parquet`.

Here’s an example of how to export a database
using the CSV format for data files.

```
EXPORT DATABASE '/path/to/export' (format="csv", header=true);
```

## Import database

The `IMPORT DATABASE` command imports the contents of the database from a specific directory to which
a Kuzu database was exported to using `EXPORT DATABASE` command. Under the hood, this command uses the
Cypher and data files that were created by the `EXPORT DATABASE` command to recreate the necessary databases
and tables in the new Kuzu version you are migrating to.

The query below imports the database from a directory named `/path/to/export` to
the current database directory that your session points to:

```
IMPORT DATABASE '/path/to/export';
```
