# Runtime API

## Background

[](#background)

An `EmailEvent` is the event type to programmatically process your emails with a Worker. You can reject, forward, or drop emails according to the logic you construct in your Worker.

---

## Syntax: ES modules

[](#syntax-es-modules)

`EmailEvent` can be handled in Workers functions written using the [ES modules format](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) by adding an `email` function to your module's exported handlers:

```javascript
export default {
  async email(message, env, ctx) {
    await message.forward("<YOUR_EMAIL>");
  },
};
```

### Parameters

[](#parameters)

- `message` ForwardableEmailMessage
  - A [`ForwardableEmailMessage` object](#forwardableemailmessage-definition).
- `env` object
  - An object containing the bindings associated with your Worker using ES modules format, such as KV namespaces and Durable Objects.
- `ctx` object
  - An object containing the context associated with your Worker using ES modules format. Currently, this object just contains the `waitUntil` function.

---

## Syntax: Service Worker

[](#syntax-service-worker)

`EmailEvent` can be handled in Workers functions written using the Service Worker syntax by attaching to the `email` event with `addEventListener`:

```javascript
addEventListener("email", async (event) => {
  await event.message.forward("<YOUR_EMAIL>");
});
```

### Properties

[](#properties)

- `event.message` ForwardableEmailMessage
  - An [`ForwardableEmailMessage` object](#forwardableemailmessage-definition).

---

## `ForwardableEmailMessage` definition

[](#forwardableemailmessage-definition)

```typescript
interface ForwardableEmailMessage<Body = unknown> {
  readonly from: string;
  readonly to: string;
  readonly headers: Headers;
  readonly raw: ReadableStream;
  readonly rawSize: number;

  public constructor(from: string, to: string, raw: ReadableStream | string);

  setReject(reason: string): void;
  forward(rcptTo: string, headers?: Headers): Promise<void>;
  reply(message: EmailMessage): Promise<void>;
}
```

An email message that is sent to a consumer Worker and can be rejected/forwarded.

- `from` string

- `rawSize` number
  - Size of the email message content.
- `setReject(reasonstring)` : void
  - Reject this email message by returning a permanent SMTP error back to the connecting client, including the given reason.
- `forward(rcptTostring, headersHeadersoptional)` : Promise
  - Forward this email message to a verified destination address of the account. If you want, you can add extra headers to the email message. Only `X-*` headers are allowed.
  - When the promise resolves, the message is confirmed to be forwarded to a verified destination address.
